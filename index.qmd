Economics PhD Candidate<br>
The Ohio State University

I'm an Economics PhD candidate researching Labor Economics, Health Economics, and Economics of Science and Innovation. My research leverages electronic health record and spatial data to study the intersection of health equity and urban nature. My journalism and community projects value the partnership between open science tools and data literacy as a way to build power and effect change.
