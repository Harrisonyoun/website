<div class="contact-simple">
I research **Labor Economic**, **Health Economics**, and **Economics of Science and Innovation**. 

In my research, I combine **data** and **causal inference** to answer my questions. I am particularly interested in **how the labor market and healthcare system interact** through various feedback channels, how changing incentives affect the behavior of employers and employees, and how market frictions, benefits, and costs are distributed across different actors. 

I also study how **human capital** and labor market outcomes are shaped by **scientific knowledge spillovers** and **innovation**.

Previously, I served as a research associate at the <br>**National University of Singapore (NUS)** for two years.
