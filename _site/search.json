I am particularly interested in how the labor market and healthcare system interact through various feedback channels, how changing incentives affect the behavior of employers and employees, and how market frictions, benefits, and costs are distributed across different actors.\nI also study how human capital and labor market outcomes are shaped by scientific knowledge spillovers and innovation.\nPreviously, I served as a research associate at the National University of Singapore (NUS) for two years.\n\n CV\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
