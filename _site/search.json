    "text": "Fong and Youn (2023). Assessing patterns and stability of ADL hierarchical scales for functional disability assessment. In The Gerontologist (Oxford University Press).  abstract\n\n\n\nThis study examined the stability over time of activities of daily living (ADL) items in 3 comparable longitudinal data sets and evaluated ADL loss sequences for older adults in the United States, South Korea, and Japan.\n\n\n\nData from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study, and its 2 international sister surveys, were analyzed. Participants were community-dwelling adults aged 60 and older. For each data set, Rasch analysis was implemented to determine if the ordering of items remained stable across multiple waves (2006–2014), such that a single ADL hierarchy may be derived from multiwave data.\n\n\n\nData fitted the Rasch model well. Item calibrations were sufficiently stable across measurement periods in each data set, reflecting a stable frame of reference. Results were also robust to sample variations. The derived ADL hierarchies based on scaled logit scores revealed that “dressing” and “bathing” were relatively more difficult items for older adults in all study populations.\n\n\n\nScale stability is essential when exploiting longitudinal data to analyze patterns in ADL disabilities. The consistency in ADL scales across measurement periods supports their use as screening tools and identifying those at risk for transitions in care. Interventions to reduce dependency in bathing and dressing can help improve independent functioning for community-dwelling older adults.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Labor Market Responses to Health Insurance Decoupling”  abstract\n\n\nIn this paper, I examine the labor market responses when employer sponsored health insurance, the single largest U.S. health insurance covering 165 million Americans, is decoupled from the U.S. labor market. This systematic decoupling creates spillovers and labor market distortions through feedback loop and reallocate the incentive structures of broader U.S. workforce. I both theoretically and empirically examine the mechanisms. I find employment elasticity responses aligned with the incentive bindings at the margins. My results carry direct implications for U.S. health insurance policy, which currently spend 24% of the federal budget.\n\n\n“Intergenerational Dilemma: Balancing Windfalls and Burdens of Public Transfers”  abstract\n\n\nOver the past few decades, the global demographic landscape has rapidly transformed with the onset of an unprecedented era of population aging. Among others, South Korea has emerged as the world’s fastest-aging country, exhibiting the lowest total fertility rates and the most rapid growth in the elderly population (Bloom et al., 2023). Despite this demographic shift, the nationwide development of old-age income security measures was introduced relatively late, in the early 2000s, in response to an elderly poverty rate exceeding 40% (Chung, 2024). To provide financial security to the ever-increasing elderly population, the Korean government introduced the Basic Pension (BP) system in 2008. This non-contributory pension unconditionally transfers cash to 70% of the population aged 65 or older, providing windfalls for the elderly, while funding is sourced from shrinking younger generations.\n\n\nThe adult children of financially insecure elderly parents may face particularly constrained economic decisions across various life-cycle stages, as they may have to bear the dual responsibility of increasing BP funding burdens and providing financial support to their financially insecure parents. If BP benefits completely crowd out financial support from adult children, the burden on the children will be eased, but the elderly parents will have no windfall gains (Becker, 1974). However, if the benefits only partially crowd out financial support from adult children, the parents will experience windfall gains while the adult children remain burdened with continuing to provide both public and familial financial support for their parents (Cox et al., 2004).\n\n\nHow should we achieve an intergenerational balance between the windfalls that benefit the elderly and the burdens that affect their children? While existing studies mainly focus on potential crowding-out effects for policy evaluations (Nikolov and Bonci, 2020), the literature is silent on “how recipients utilize the benefits they receive.” For example, if windfall gains of elderly parents are shared with their children, both parents’ and children’s net gains may vary. In this paper, I present new evidence on the importance of the impact of recipients’ shared benefits, which I term the spillover effect, alongside the crowding-out effect to understand net gains from public and family transfers in Korea, crucial for balancing windfalls and burdens in intergenerational public and household finances.\n\n\nI find evidence that BP benefits displaced the transfer burdens of adult children for elderly single households and resulted in net gains for both family members and recipients in elderly couple households living without children. However, elderly couples living with their children experienced net gains, with the wealth of their children being redistributed from non-coresident to coresident children. The findings suggest that considering how recipients utilized their benefits can alter policy evaluations, contrasting with current literature.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Killing Me Softly With Dinner: The Costs of Circadian Misalignment”"

Why does the law fail in labor markets?\nThe failure of wage equalization reveals market frictions:\n\nIncomplete information: Workers do not observe all job offers or wage distributions.\nLimited mobility: Geography, family ties, or institutional constraints can limit movement.\nFirm heterogeneity: Employers differ in productivity, market power, and rent-sharing norms.\nSearch and matching frictions: Job-finding is not instantaneous, and not all workers see the same set of firms.\n\nThus, we arrive at an important question in labor economics:\n\nAre wage differences mainly about “who” the worker is, or “where” they work?"

It reveals that inequality is not just about who you are, but also very much about where you work."

    "text": "In labor economics, a fundamental question has always been: why do wages differ so much between workers? While observable factors like education and experience explain a part of this variation, a large portion remains a puzzle. For decades, economists debated the source of this remaining inequality. Is it that some people are simply more productive and talented, earning a high wage wherever they go? Or is it that some firms are more generous, productive, or willing to share profits, offering high wages to whomever they employ?\nThis is not just an academic question. The answer shapes our understanding of inequality, labor mobility, and the very nature of compensation. If wages are mostly about “people,” then individual skills and human capital are paramount. If they are about the “place,” then firm-level policies, industry dynamics, and bargaining power take center stage.\nIn 1999, John M. Abowd, Francis Kramarz, and David N. Margolis (AKM) published a groundbreaking paper in Econometrica titled “High Wage Workers and High Wage Firms” that provided a revolutionary way to answer this question. [cite: 3] Using a massive longitudinal dataset from France that linked over a million workers to their employers over time, they developed a statistical framework to decompose wages into a component attributable to the individual (a “person effect”) and a component attributable to the employer (a “firm effect”). [cite: 5, 6]\nThis post will serve as a detailed guide to the AKM paper, walking through their statistical model, the challenges of estimating it, and their landmark findings that have shaped the field of labor economics for decades."

    "text": "The AKM Model: A Two-Way Street\nThe core of the AKM methodology is a linear statistical model that decomposes the logarithm of a worker’s wage into several parts. The central insight is to treat the unobserved, persistent abilities of individuals and the unobserved, persistent pay policies of firms as fixed effects.\n\nThe Governing Equation\nLet \\(y_{it}\\) be the logarithm of total annual compensation for person \\(i\\) at firm \\(J(i,t)\\) in year \\(t\\). The model proposed by AKM can be expressed as:\n\\[\ny_{it} = \\mathbf{x}_{it}\\beta + \\theta_i + \\psi_{J(i,t)} + \\epsilon_{it}\n\\]\nLet’s break down each component intuitively:\n\n\\(\\mathbf{x}_{it}\\beta\\): This is the predictable part of wages based on observable, time-varying characteristics of the worker. [cite: 89] In the AKM paper, this primarily includes a flexible polynomial in labor force experience and year dummies to capture macroeconomic trends. [cite: 955, 965] The vector \\(\\beta\\) contains the returns to these characteristics.\n\\(\\theta_i\\): This is the pure person effect. It represents all of the stable, time-invariant characteristics of worker \\(i\\) that affect their wages, both observable (like education) and unobservable (like innate ability, motivation, or valuable skills). [cite: 90] You can think of \\(\\theta_i\\) as the portion of a worker’s earning power that they carry with them from job to job. A worker with a high \\(\\theta_i\\) is a “high-wage worker.” [cite: 37]\n\\(\\psi_{J(i,t)}\\): This is the pure firm effect. It represents the wage premium (or penalty) associated with working at firm \\(j\\) (where \\(j = J(i,t)\\)), holding constant all worker characteristics (both \\(\\mathbf{x}_{it}\\) and \\(\\theta_i\\)). [cite: 90] A firm with a high \\(\\psi_j\\) is a “high-wage firm”—it pays more than other firms for the exact same worker. [cite: 38] This effect could arise from efficiency wages, rent-sharing, better technology, or any other firm-level policy.\n\\(\\epsilon_{it}\\): This is the statistical residual, capturing any remaining wage variation not explained by the model, such as measurement error or transitory wage shocks. [cite: 90]\n\nIn the paper, the authors further decompose the person effect \\(\\theta_i\\) into a part explained by time-invariant observables like education (\\(u_i\\eta\\)) and a residual unobserved component (\\(\\alpha_i\\)). [cite: 348, 351] They also allow the firm effect \\(\\psi_j\\) to be more complex, including a firm-specific intercept (\\(\\phi_j\\)) and a firm-specific return to seniority (\\(\\gamma_j\\)). [cite: 354, 356]\nThe full model can be expressed in matrix form as:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\beta + \\mathbf{D}\\theta + \\mathbf{F}\\psi + \\epsilon\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) is a matrix of dummy variables for each person and \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) is a matrix of dummy variables for each firm. [cite: 115]\n\n\nThe Identification Challenge: Why Worker Mobility is Key\nAt first glance, this looks like a standard linear regression. However, estimating it presents two major challenges.\n\nComputational Burden: The French dataset contained roughly 1 million workers and 500,000 firms. [cite: 5] This means the design matrix includes about 1.5 million columns for the fixed effects alone. Inverting a matrix of this size to solve the least squares problem was computationally infeasible at the time. [cite: 41, 385, 386]\nStatistical Identification: More fundamentally, how can we possibly separate the person effect from the firm effect? If a worker stays at the same firm for their entire career, it’s impossible to know if their high wage is due to their own talent (\\(\\theta_i\\)) or the firm’s generosity (\\(\\psi_j\\)).\n\nThe genius of the AKM approach lies in using worker mobility to solve the identification problem. The person and firm effects can be separately identified for the group of workers who move between firms. When a worker \\(i\\) moves from firm \\(j\\) to firm \\(k\\), their person effect \\(\\theta_i\\) moves with them. The change in their wage, after accounting for changes in experience, can be attributed to the difference in the firm effects (\\(\\psi_k - \\psi_j\\)).\nBy observing millions of such moves, the model can trace out the entire network of firm premiums. The dataset forms a “connected set” where there is a path of mobile workers linking all the firms, allowing for the identification of both person and firm effects for all individuals and firms within that set. [cite: 388, 389] In their sample, 88.5% of individuals contributed to the estimation of firm effects through this network of mobility. [cite: 414, 415]"

    "section": "Estimation Strategies",
    "text": "Estimation Strategies\nGiven the computational infeasibility of a direct least squares estimation, AKM employed several clever strategies to approximate the solution.\n\n1. Consistent Estimation\nThe authors first show that some parameters, like the returns to experience (\\(\\beta\\)) and the firm-specific slope of seniority (\\(\\gamma_j\\)), can be estimated consistently by taking first-differences for workers within the same firm. [cite: 422, 423] This “within-firm, within-person” difference eliminates both the person effect \\(\\theta_i\\) and the firm-specific intercept \\(\\phi_j\\), isolating the time-varying components. [cite: 424-427] While this method is robust, it cannot identify the firm intercept or the person effect, which are the main objects of interest. [cite: 458]\n\n\n2. Conditional Methods\nTo estimate all parameters, AKM developed “conditional” methods that approximate the full least squares solution. The main idea is to impose certain orthogonality conditions to make the problem computationally tractable. [cite: 462, 463] They discuss two main variants:\n\nOrder-Dependent (“Persons First”): This became their preferred method for its strong empirical performance. [cite: 1197] It works in two steps:\n\nStep 1: First, account for all person-level effects. Regress wages on the full set of person dummies (\\(\\mathbf{D}\\)) and time-varying controls (\\(\\mathbf{X}\\)). The estimated person effects (\\(\\hat{\\theta}_i\\)) capture a worker’s average wage across all their jobs, purged of experience effects. [cite: 572]\nStep 2: Take the residuals from the first step. These residuals represent the component of wages that varies within a person’s career as they move between firms. Then, regress these residuals on the set of firm dummies (\\(\\mathbf{F}\\)) to estimate the firm effects (\\(\\hat{\\psi}_j\\)). [cite: 574, 584]\n\nOrder-Independent: This method estimates the person effects and firm effects in separate, parallel steps, imposing statistical assumptions that render the order irrelevant. [cite: 500, 501] While theoretically appealing, AKM’s diagnostic tests showed that the firm effects from this method were less reliable than the “persons first” approach. [cite: 1088]\n\nAKM’s key finding from comparing methods was that any approach estimating person effects first performed better than methods that estimated firm effects first. [cite: 60] This is because person effects explain a much larger share of the wage variance, so accounting for them first provides a more accurate foundation for estimating the smaller firm effects."

    "text": "The Landmark Findings\nThe results from the AKM decomposition were transformative. They provided clear, quantitative answers to long-standing questions in labor economics.\n\nFinding 1: People Matter More Than the Place\nThe most striking result is the overwhelming importance of person effects. AKM found that individual heterogeneity (\\(\\theta_i\\)) is the dominant source of wage variation in France. [cite: 8, 1196]\n\nThe standard deviation of person effects was substantially larger than the standard deviation of firm effects. [cite: 9, 1106]\nPerson effects, particularly the unobservable component (\\(\\alpha_i\\)), are the single component most highly correlated with an individual’s total compensation. [cite: 1186]\nCrucially, the correlation between the person effect and the firm effect was positive but small (between 0.08 and 0.15 depending on the method). [cite: 1187, 1188] This indicates that there is only weak sorting of high-wage workers into high-wage firms.\n\n\n\nFinding 2: The Inter-Industry Wage Differential is a “People” Story\nEconomists had long observed that some industries (e.g., manufacturing, mining) consistently pay higher wages than others (e.g., retail, services), even after controlling for observable worker characteristics. The AKM framework allowed them to decompose this industry premium.\nTheir finding was unambiguous: about 90% of inter-industry wage differentials are explained by person effects. [cite: 13, 63] It’s not that the oil industry is inherently generous; it’s that the oil industry hires workers who would have earned high wages no matter where they worked. The “firm effect” component of industry wages was negligible. [cite: 64, 1218] This result largely settled the debate in favor of the view that industry premiums reflect the sorting of workers with different skills across sectors."

This matching is not random; it is the result of a two-sided search.\nWorkers seek out the best firms: Ambitious and talented individuals actively look for companies that offer higher wages, better benefits, and greater opportunities for growth.\nFirms seek out the best workers: The most successful and profitable firms compete to recruit and retain the most skilled and productive talent to maintain their competitive edge.\nThis non-random sorting creates a major statistical hurdle.

    "text": "The AKM Model: Decomposing the Wage Equation\nThe AKM model decomposes a worker’s wage into individual characteristics, a person fixed effect, a firm fixed effect, and an error term.\nThe model is specified by the following equation:\n\\[\ny_{it} = \\mathbf{x}_{it}'\\beta + \\theta_i + \\psi_{J(i,t)} + \\varepsilon_{it}\n\\]\nEach term is defined as follows:\n\n\\(y_{it}\\): The log wage of worker \\(i\\) at time \\(t\\). Taking the logarithm allows us to analyze the proportional changes in wages and has the statistical benefit of making the distribution more closely resemble a normal distribution.\n\\(\\mathbf{x}_{it}\\): A vector of time-varying observable characteristics for worker \\(i\\) at time \\(t\\). This typically includes variables like potential experience (often as both experience and experience-squared), and other changing attributes. \\(\\beta\\) is the vector of coefficients representing the returns to these characteristics.\n\\(\\theta_i\\) (Person Fixed Effect): This is a core component of the model. It represents the unobserved, time-invariant characteristics unique to worker \\(i\\). It captures all the portable value a worker carries with them from job to job, such as innate talent, motivation, personal networks, and negotiation skills.\n\\(\\psi_{J(i,t)}\\) (Firm Fixed Effect): The other key component. It represents the unique wage premium associated with firm \\(j\\) (where \\(j = J(i,t)\\)), which employs worker \\(i\\) at time \\(t\\). This effect is attributed to the firm’s productivity, pay policies, market power, union presence, and other factors that apply equally to all workers within that firm.\n\\(\\varepsilon_{it}\\): A pure stochastic error term. It captures measurement errors and transitory wage shocks, such as a one-time bonus, that are not explained by the other factors. This error is assumed to be uncorrelated with all other variables in the model (\\(E[\\varepsilon_{it} | \\mathbf{x}, \\theta, \\psi] = 0\\)).\n\nBecause this model simultaneously controls for fixed effects at two distinct levels (person and firm), it is known as a Two-Way Fixed Effects Model.\n\n\nIdentification Problem: Is It Skill or a Great Place to Work?\nWe have the model, but how can we possibly distinguish \\(\\theta_i\\) from \\(\\psi_j\\)? This is the core identification problem.\nConsider a simple scenario. Worker Alice at Firm A earns more than Worker Bob at Firm B. What is the source of this difference?\n\nThe Person Effect Hypothesis: Alice is more skilled and productive than Bob (a higher \\(\\theta_{Alice}\\)).\nThe Firm Effect Hypothesis: Firm A is a better-paying company than Firm B (a higher \\(\\psi_A\\)).\n\nIf no one ever changes jobs, it is impossible to distinguish between these two effects. We cannot statistically separate whether a worker’s high wage is due to their inherent ability or the generosity of their employer. It’s like having a single equation \\(x+y=10\\) and trying to solve for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\nThe Solution: Worker Mobility\nThe genius of AKM was to find the key to identification in worker mobility. By tracking wage changes when workers move between firms, we can begin to isolate the two effects.\n\nSuppose a worker \\(i\\) moves from Firm A to Firm B.\nThe worker’s person effect, \\(\\theta_i\\), is “portable” and is assumed to remain constant across jobs.\nTherefore, the change in the worker’s wage (\\(\\Delta y_i\\)) primarily reflects the difference in the firm effects (\\(\\psi_B - \\psi_A\\)).\n\n\\[\n\\Delta y_i = y_{i,t_2} - y_{i,t_1} = (\\theta_i + \\psi_B) - (\\theta_i + \\psi_A) + \\dots = (\\psi_B - \\psi_A) + \\dots\n\\]\nBy observing millions of such moves across different firms, we obtain a vast set of relative firm effect differences, like \\((\\psi_j - \\psi_k)\\).\n\n\nThe Connected Graph\nBy piecing together these relative differences like a puzzle, we can eventually align the wage premiums (\\(\\psi_j\\)) of all firms on a common scale. However, this is only possible if worker moves form one large, connected mobility graph.\nFor instance, if Alice moves from Firm A to B, and Charles moves from Firm B to C, we can now link all three firms and compare the relative pay premiums of A, B, and C. As long as these chains of moves are sufficiently widespread throughout the economy, the effects for most firms and workers can be identified. In the French dataset analyzed by AKM, over 88.5% of the labor force was part of this single connected network (p.268)."

    "text": "Estimation Strategy: Solving a Massive Problem\n\nThe Computational Challenge\nWhile theoretically elegant, estimating the AKM model presents a formidable computational hurdle. The model requires estimating fixed effects for millions of individuals (\\(\\theta_i\\)) and hundreds of thousands of firms (\\(\\psi_j\\)) simultaneously. This is equivalent to a regression with millions of dummy variables, making standard Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) computationally infeasible due to the immense size of the matrix (\\(X'X\\)) that needs to be inverted.\n\n\nThe Practical Solution: Step-wise Residual Regression (An Application of the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell Theorem)\nTo overcome this, AKM employed efficient computational methods that break the problem down into manageable steps, applying the principles of the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem. A common approach is as follows:\n\nStep 1: Purging the Person Effect For each worker \\(i\\), calculate the mean of all variables over time (e.g., \\(\\bar{y}_i, \\bar{\\mathbf{x}}_i, \\bar{\\psi}_i\\)).
