Participants were community-dwelling adults aged 60 and older. For each data set, Rasch analysis was implemented to determine if the ordering of items remained stable across multiple waves (2006–2014), such that a single ADL hierarchy may be derived from multiwave data.\nResults Data fitted the Rasch model well. Item calibrations were sufficiently stable across measurement periods in each data set, reflecting a stable frame of reference. Results were also robust to sample variations. The derived ADL hierarchies based on scaled logit scores revealed that “dressing” and “bathing” were relatively more difficult items for older adults in all study populations.\nDiscussion and Implications Scale stability is essential when exploiting longitudinal data to analyze patterns in ADL disabilities. The consistency in ADL scales across measurement periods supports their use as screening tools and identifying those at risk for transitions in care. Interventions to reduce dependency in bathing and dressing can help improve independent functioning for community-dwelling older adults.\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span class=\"close\" onclick=\"closeModal('jmp-abstract')\"&gt;&times;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Who Benefits from Workplace Accommodations?

I am particularly interested in how the labor market and healthcare system interact through various feedback channels, how changing incentives affect the behavior of employers and employees, and how market frictions, benefits, and costs are distributed across different actors.\nI also study how human capital and labor market outcomes are shaped by scientific knowledge spillovers and innovation.\nPreviously, I served as a research associate at the National University of Singapore (NUS) for two years.\n\n CV\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
