This systematic decoupling creates spillovers and labor market distortions through feedback loop and reallocate the incentive structures of broader U.S. workforce. I both theoretically and empirically examine the mechanisms. I find employment elasticity responses aligned with the incentive bindings at the margins. My results carry direct implications for U.S. health insurance policy, which currently spend 24% of the federal budget.\n\n\n“Intergenerational Dilemma: Balancing Windfalls and Burdens of Public Transfers”  abstract\n\n\nOver the past few decades, the global demographic landscape has rapidly transformed with the onset of an unprecedented era of population aging. Among others, South Korea has emerged as the world’s fastest-aging country, exhibiting the lowest total fertility rates and the most rapid growth in the elderly population (Bloom et al., 2023). Despite this demographic shift, the nationwide development of old-age income security measures was introduced relatively late, in the early 2000s, in response to an elderly poverty rate exceeding 40% (Chung, 2024). To provide financial security to the ever-increasing elderly population, the Korean government introduced the Basic Pension (BP) system in 2008. This non-contributory pension unconditionally transfers cash to 70% of the population aged 65 or older, providing windfalls for the elderly, while funding is sourced from shrinking younger generations.\n\n\nThe adult children of financially insecure elderly parents may face particularly constrained economic decisions across various life-cycle stages, as they may have to bear the dual responsibility of increasing BP funding burdens and providing financial support to their financially insecure parents. If BP benefits completely crowd out financial support from adult children, the burden on the children will be eased, but the elderly parents will have no windfall gains (Becker, 1974). However, if the benefits only partially crowd out financial support from adult children, the parents will experience windfall gains while the adult children remain burdened with continuing to provide both public and familial financial support for their parents (Cox et al., 2004).\n\n\nHow should we achieve an intergenerational balance between the windfalls that benefit the elderly and the burdens that affect their children? While existing studies mainly focus on potential crowding-out effects for policy evaluations (Nikolov and Bonci, 2020), the literature is silent on “how recipients utilize the benefits they receive.” For example, if windfall gains of elderly parents are shared with their children, both parents’ and children’s net gains may vary. In this paper, I present new evidence on the importance of the impact of recipients’ shared benefits, which I term the spillover effect, alongside the crowding-out effect to understand net gains from public and family transfers in Korea, crucial for balancing windfalls and burdens in intergenerational public and household finances.\n\n\nI find evidence that BP benefits displaced the transfer burdens of adult children for elderly single households and resulted in net gains for both family members and recipients in elderly couple households living without children. However, elderly couples living with their children experienced net gains, with the wealth of their children being redistributed from non-coresident to coresident children. The findings suggest that considering how recipients utilized their benefits can alter policy evaluations, contrasting with current literature."

    "section": "The AKM Framework",
    "text": "The AKM Framework\nIn their 1999 paper, High Wage Workers and High Wage Firms, John Abowd, Francis Kramarz, and David Margolis (hereafter AKM) formalized a method to decompose wages into:\n\nPerson effect: what a worker earns across jobs due to their intrinsic attributes\nFirm effect: what a firm pays, regardless of who works there\n\nBefore the AKM framework, separating how much of a person’s wage was due to their individual skill versus the firm they worked for was a fundamental and notoriously difficult problem.\nThe primary obstacle is positive assortative matching, or the strong tendency for high-skilled workers to be employed at high-paying, highly productive firms. This matching is not random; it is the result of a two-sided search.\nWorkers seek out the best firms: Ambitious and talented individuals actively look for companies that offer higher wages, better benefits, and greater opportunities for growth.\nFirms seek out the best workers: The most successful and profitable firms compete to recruit and retain the most skilled and productive talent to maintain their competitive edge.\nThis non-random sorting creates a major statistical hurdle. If you simply observe that “Firm A” pays higher average wages than “Firm B,” you cannot know the true cause. Is Firm A genuinely more generous or productive (a high firm effect), or has it simply managed to hire a more skilled workforce (a concentration of high person effects)?\nWith traditional data, such as a cross-sectional survey of workers and firms at a single point in time, these two forces are statistically entangled. Any attempt to measure the firm’s true pay premium would be contaminated by the unobserved skills of the workers it hired. This is a classic case of omitted variable bias, where “innate worker ability” is the omitted variable that biases the estimate of the firm’s effect on wages. Without the ability to track the same worker as they move between different firms, we were largely unable to resolve this puzzle.\nTheir innovation relied on matched employer-employee longitudinal data, allowing them to track millions of workers as they moved across firms over time."

    "text": "The AKM Model: Decomposing the Wage Equation\nThe AKM model decomposes a worker’s wage into individual characteristics, a person fixed effect, a firm fixed effect, and an error term.\nThe model is specified by the following equation:\n\\[\ny_{it} = \\mathbf{x}_{it}'\\beta + \\theta_i + \\psi_{J(i,t)} + \\varepsilon_{it}\n\\]\nEach term is defined as follows:\n\n\\(y_{it}\\): The log wage of worker \\(i\\) at time \\(t\\). Taking the logarithm allows us to analyze the proportional changes in wages and has the statistical benefit of making the distribution more closely resemble a normal distribution.\n\\(\\mathbf{x}_{it}\\): A vector of time-varying observable characteristics for worker \\(i\\) at time \\(t\\). This typically includes variables like potential experience (often as both experience and experience-squared), and other changing attributes. \\(\\beta\\) is the vector of coefficients representing the returns to these characteristics.\n\\(\\theta_i\\) (Person Fixed Effect): This is a core component of the model. It represents the unobserved, time-invariant characteristics unique to worker \\(i\\). It captures all the portable value a worker carries with them from job to job, such as innate talent, motivation, personal networks, and negotiation skills.\n\\(\\psi_{J(i,t)}\\) (Firm Fixed Effect): The other key component. It represents the unique wage premium associated with firm \\(j\\) (where \\(j = J(i,t)\\)), which employs worker \\(i\\) at time \\(t\\). This effect is attributed to the firm’s productivity, pay policies, market power, union presence, and other factors that apply equally to all workers within that firm.\n\\(\\varepsilon_{it}\\): A pure stochastic error term. It captures measurement errors and transitory wage shocks, such as a one-time bonus, that are not explained by the other factors. This error is assumed to be uncorrelated with all other variables in the model (\\(E[\\varepsilon_{it} | \\mathbf{x}, \\theta, \\psi] = 0\\)).\n\nBecause this model simultaneously controls for fixed effects at two distinct levels (person and firm), it is known as a Two-Way Fixed Effects Model."

    "text": "Identification Problem: Skill or Good Workplace?\nWe have the model, but how can we possibly distinguish \\(\\theta_i\\) from \\(\\psi_j\\)? This is the core identification problem.\nConsider a simple scenario. Worker Alice at Firm A earns more than Worker Bob at Firm B. What is the source of this difference?\n\nThe Person Effect Hypothesis: Alice is more skilled and productive than Bob (a higher \\(\\theta_{Alice}\\)).\nThe Firm Effect Hypothesis: Firm A is a better-paying company than Firm B (a higher \\(\\psi_A\\)).\n\nIf no one ever changes jobs, it is impossible to distinguish between these two effects. We cannot statistically separate whether a worker’s high wage is due to their inherent ability or the generosity of their employer. It’s like having a single equation \\(x+y=10\\) and trying to solve for both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\nThe Solution: Worker Mobility\nThe genius of AKM was to find the key to identification in worker mobility. By tracking wage changes when workers move between firms, we can begin to isolate the two effects.\n\nSuppose a worker \\(i\\) moves from Firm A to Firm B.\nThe worker’s person effect, \\(\\theta_i\\), is “portable” and is assumed to remain constant across jobs.\nTherefore, the change in the worker’s wage (\\(\\Delta y_i\\)) primarily reflects the difference in the firm effects (\\(\\psi_B - \\psi_A\\)).\n\n\\[\n\\Delta y_i = y_{i,t_2} - y_{i,t_1} = (\\theta_i + \\psi_B) - (\\theta_i + \\psi_A) + \\dots = (\\psi_B - \\psi_A) + \\dots\n\\]\nBy observing millions of such moves across different firms, we obtain a vast set of relative firm effect differences, like \\((\\psi_j - \\psi_k)\\).\n\n\nThe Connected Set\nBy piecing together these relative differences like a puzzle, we can eventually align the wage premiums (\\(\\psi_j\\)) of all firms on a common scale. However, this is only possible if worker moves form one large, connected mobility set.\nFor instance, if Alice moves from Firm A to B, and Charles moves from Firm B to C, we can now link all three firms and compare the relative pay premiums of A, B, and C. As long as these chains of moves are sufficiently widespread throughout the economy, the effects for most firms and workers can be identified. In the French dataset analyzed by AKM, over 88.5% of the labor force was part of this single connected network (p.268)."

    "section": "Estimation Strategy: Solving a Massive Problem",
    "text": "Estimation Strategy: Solving a Massive Problem\n\nThe Computational Challenge\nWhile theoretically elegant, estimating the AKM model presents a formidable computational hurdle. The model requires estimating fixed effects for millions of individuals (\\(\\theta_i\\)) and hundreds of thousands of firms (\\(\\psi_j\\)) simultaneously. This is equivalent to a regression with millions of dummy variables, making standard Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) computationally infeasible due to the immense size of the matrix (\\(X'X\\)) that needs to be inverted.\n\n\nThe Practical Solution: Step-wise Residual Regression (An Application of the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell Theorem)\nTo overcome this, AKM employed efficient computational methods that break the problem down into manageable steps, applying the principles of the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem. A common approach is as follows:\n\nStep 1: Purging the Person Effect For each worker \\(i\\), calculate the mean of all variables over time (e.g., \\(\\bar{y}_i, \\bar{\\mathbf{x}}_i, \\bar{\\psi}_i\\)). Then, subtract these person-specific means from the original wage equation. This is known as the within-transformation. \\[\ny_{it} - \\bar{y}_i = (\\mathbf{x}_{it} - \\bar{\\mathbf{x}}_i)'\\beta + (\\psi_{J(i,t)} - \\bar{\\psi}_i) + (\\varepsilon_{it} - \\bar{\\varepsilon}_i)\n\\] This process mathematically eliminates the person fixed effect \\(\\theta_i\\) from the equation, leaving us with the task of estimating the firm effects \\(\\psi_j\\).\nStep 2: Estimating the Firm Effect Using the equation from which the person effects have been removed, one can now estimate \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\psi_j\\). While still computationally intensive, this reduced problem can be solved using various iterative algorithms.\n\nAKM noted that because person effects explain substantially more of the variance in wages than firm effects, controlling for them first improves the statistical precision of the estimates."

    "section": "Key Findings from AKM (1999) and Their Implications",
    "text": "Key Findings from AKM (1999) and Their Implications\n\n1. Person Effects Dominate Wage Variation\n\nThe standard deviation of person fixed effects (\\(\\theta_i\\)) is substantially larger (more than twice as large) than that of firm fixed effects (\\(\\psi_j\\)).\nThis means that most of the inequality in wages comes from differences in workers’ portable skills and abilities, while differences in firm pay policies are a secondary factor.\n\n\nImplication: Policies aimed at reducing wage inequality might be more effective if they focus on education and skill-building (enhancing \\(\\theta_i\\)) rather than solely on regulating firm pay gaps.\n\n\n\n2. Inter-Industry Wage Gaps Are About Sorting, Not Firms\nThe reason high-wage industries (e.g., finance, tech) pay more is not because the firms in them are uniquely generous, but because they sort and hire workers who are already highly skilled (have high \\(\\theta_i\\)).\n\nApproximately 90% of the wage differential between industries is explained by this sorting of workers.\nIn other words, workers in high-paying industries would likely earn above-average wages no matter where they worked.\n\n\nImplication: A policy to subsidize a specific industry may not benefit low-wage workers as much as intended. The benefits could be disproportionately captured by the high-skilled workers the industry attracts.\n\n\n\n3. The Firm-Size Premium is Also Mostly Sorting\nIt is well-known that large firms tend to pay more than small firms. AKM revealed that this is also largely because they hire better workers.\n\nAbout 75% of the wage gap associated with firm size is explained by person effects (\\(\\theta_i\\)).\nAfter accounting for sorting, the pure firm-size wage premium is small and not consistently increasing with size.\n\n\nImplication: Policies aimed at closing the large-small firm wage gap by regulating large firms’ pay may miss the root cause. A more effective approach might be to help small and medium-sized enterprises attract skilled talent and improve their productivity.\n\n\n\n4. High-Paying Firms Are Genuinely More Productive\nFirms with high firm effects (\\(\\psi_j\\)), those that pay workers more than their estimated market value, also tend to be more productive and more profitable.\n\nThis finding provides strong support for efficiency wage theories (where firms pay above-market wages to motivate workers and reduce turnover) and rent-sharing theories (where firms share their excess profits, or “rents,” with their employees).\n\n\nImplication: Paying high wages is not just a cost; it can be a strategic decision correlated with superior firm performance."

The framework has become a foundational tool in countless subsequent studies.\n\nGender Wage Gap Research: Used to decompose the gap into differences in sorting (men and women working in different types of firms) versus differences in pay within the same firm.\nLabor Market Power: Used to measure the extent of rent-sharing and analyze how the bargaining power between firms and workers has evolved.\nAnalysis of Trade Shocks: Used to see if workers displaced from import-competing industries are re-employed at firms with lower wage premiums (\\(\\psi_j\\)).\nInequality Dynamics: Used to explore whether a worker’s wage growth over their career is due to personal skill growth or to moving to better firms.\n\nThe AKM model provided a powerful microscope to answer fundamental economic questions with complex labor market data, and it remains one of the most important tools in labor economics today.\nMore broadly, AKM marked a turning point in labor economics by treating worker and firm fixed effects not as nuisance parameters but as core parameters of interest. This shift led to the widespread adoption of high-dimensional fixed effects regressions in matched employer-employee data. Rather than relying solely on firm observables like size or sector, economists began using large-scale administrative data to identify which firms systematically pay more or less, and then relate these patterns to observables in a second step."

In labor markets, this is the frictionless matching model, most famously associated with Nobel laureate Gary Becker.\n\nEnvironment\nLet \\(X\\) be the set of worker types (e.g. skill level) and \\(Y\\) the set of firm types (e.g. productivity or firm “quality”). For simplicity, assume \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are intervals in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) (e.g. \\([0,1]\\)) with continuous distributions of agents on each side. A matching \\(\\mu\\) is a pairing such that each worker \\(x\\) is matched to at most one firm \\(y=\\mu(x)\\), and vice versa. We focus on one-to-one matching and assume equal mass of workers and jobs for full matching (extensions to unequal numbers allow unmatched agents getting zero output).\nEach match \\((x,y)\\) produces output \\(f(x,y)\\). We assume common ranking: \\(f_x(x,y)&gt;0\\) and \\(f_y(x,y)&gt;0\\), so higher-type workers and firms are more productive partners (this ensures it’s efficient to match higher types rather than leave them idle). Crucially, utility is transferable: if worker \\(x\\) matched with firm \\(y\\) produces \\(f(x,y)\\), any split of this output can be arranged via the wage \\(w(x,y)\\) paid to the worker (the firm earns \\(f(x,y)-w(x,y)\\)). Unmatched agents get 0.\n\n\nStable Matching (TU)\nA matching \\(\\mu\\) with an associated wage schedule \\(w(x,\\mu(x))\\) is stable if: (i) Individual Rationality: every matched worker and firm gets at least 0 (their outside option); (ii) No Blocking Pair: there is no unmatched pair \\((x,y)\\) such that \\(f(x,y)\\) exceeds the sum of their current payoffs. Under TU, stability has a powerful implication: the matching must maximize total output.\n\nA matching is stable if nobody can make a better deal elsewhere. No worker and firm could sneak off, form a new pair, and both be better off. This simple “no side deals” rule is incredibly powerful.\n\nLemma (Optimality of Stable Match with TU): If a matching \\(\\mu\\) with wages \\(w(x,\\mu(x))\\) is stable, then \\(\\mu\\) maximizes aggregate output \\(\\sum_{(x,y)\\in \\mu} f(x,y)\\) (integral form for continuum). Equivalently, \\(\\mu\\) solves the assignment problem \\[\n\\max_{\\mu}\\; \\int_{X} f(x,\\mu(x))\\,dx,\n\\] subject to \\(\\mu\\) being a bijection between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).\nProof Sketch: If a matching did not maximize total output, there exist two pairs \\((x,y)\\) and \\((x',y')\\) matched such that swapping partners increases output: \\(f(x,y')+f(x',y) &gt; f(x,y)+f(x',y')\\). Then \\((x,y')\\) would form a blocking pair (since they could transfer the gain so both are better off), contradicting stability. Thus, stability implies no such improving swap exists, which is the condition for optimal assignment. Conversely, the output-maximizing assignment can always sustain a stable set of wages via transfers (pay each agent their marginal contribution or use the linear programming dual prices). This result was first shown by Becker and is analogous to the Koopmans–Beckmann assignment problem and the core of a Sharply-Shubik’s cooperative game.\n\n\nCompetitive Equilibrium Interpretation\nIn a TU matching, stable outcomes coincide with a competitive equilibrium. There exist worker-side utility \\(U(x)\\) and firm-side utility \\(V(y)\\) such that for every matched pair \\((x,y)\\): \\[\nU(x) + V(y) = f(x,y),\n\\] and for unmatched pairs \\(U(x)+V(y) \\ge f(x,y)\\). Here \\(U(x)\\) can be interpreted as the equilibrium payoff (wage) to worker \\(x\\) and \\(V(y)\\) as the payoff to firm \\(y\\) (profit). These \\((U, V)\\) are Lagrange multipliers (shadow prices) for the assignment constraints. This system of inequalities is analogous to Walrasian equilibrium: \\(U(x)\\) is the highest wage worker \\(x\\) could get across all firms, and \\(V(y)\\) the highest profit for firm \\(y\\) across all workers, such that no pair can deviate and generate surplus above these payoffs. In equilibrium, each worker–firm pair matched yields zero surplus beyond what each side could get elsewhere, i.e. \\(f(x,y) - U(x) - V(y) = 0\\) if matched (and &lt; 0 if not matched). This is the dual characterization of the optimal assignment. The wages can be obtained from these as \\(w(x,y)=U(x)\\) for the matched pair, so that indeed \\(w(x,y)+V(y)=f(x,y)\\).\n\n\nExistence and Uniqueness\nUnder mild continuity and distribution conditions, a stable (output-maximizing) matching exists. In one-dimensional settings with strict supermodularity (defined below), the stable matching is essentially unique and assortative (we’ll show it’s sorted by type). With transferable utility, no strategic issues arise, and one can solve the planner’s problem directly."

    "text": "Search Frictions and the Shimer–Smith Model\nThe frictionless model is elegant, but the real world is messy. People have to search for jobs, send out resumes, and go to interviews. The Shimer and Smith (2000) model brings these crucial search frictions into the picture.\n\nEnvironment\nTime is continuous. A measure of unemployed workers (by type \\(x\\)) search for jobs, and a measure of vacant firms (by type \\(y\\)) search for workers. Encounters are random: a worker meets a vacancy at Poisson rate \\(\\lambda\\) (and a vacancy meets a worker at rate \\(\\mu\\)). When a worker \\(x\\) meets a firm \\(y\\), they observe the potential match output \\(f(x,y)\\). They then decide whether to form a match or not. If they match, the job produces flow output \\(f(x,y)\\) per unit time and the parties split the surplus via an agreed wage \\(w(x,y)\\). If they do not match, the worker remains unemployed (with some continuation value) and the firm keeps the vacancy open.\nEach agent is forward-looking with discount rate \\(r\\). Let \\(\\delta\\) be the exogenous job separation rate (matches break up randomly). Let \\(W_0(x)\\) denote the present value of lifetime utility for an unemployed worker of type \\(x\\) (the value of searching), and \\(W_1(x,y)\\) the value if employed in a match with firm \\(y\\) at wage \\(w\\). Similarly \\(Π_0(y)\\) is the value of an open vacancy for firm \\(y\\) (the firm’s value of waiting for a hire), and \\(Π_1(x,y)\\) the value of a filled job with worker \\(x\\) (yielding profit \\(f - w\\) flow).\n\n\nMatch Surplus\nThe total surplus created when \\(x\\) meets \\(y\\) is the difference between the match value and the sum of outside options: \\[\nS(x,y) \\equiv W_1(x,y) + \\Pi_1(x,y) - W_0(x) - \\Pi_0(y).\n\\] This \\(S(x,y)\\) measures how much better off the two can be by forming a match, compared to remaining unmatched and continuing search. In a steady-state equilibrium, Shimer–Smith show that \\(S(x,y)\\) satisfies a forward-looking equation: \\[\n(r + \\delta)\\,S(x,y) = (1+r)\\,f(x,y) - r\\,W_0(x) - r\\,\\Pi_0(y),\n\\] assuming output \\(f\\) is received continuously and discounted, and the outside option values \\(W_0, Π_0\\) are treated as constants (since leaving the match returns the parties to those states). We won’t derive this in full detail, but intuitively: the LHS is the annuity value of the match surplus (including that matches eventually end at rate \\(\\delta\\)), and the RHS is current output minus the opportunity cost of tying up the worker and vacancy (who could otherwise earn \\(rW_0\\) and \\(r\\Pi_0\\) in expectation by searching).\n\n\nAcceptance (Matching) Decision\nA meeting results in a match if and only if \\(S(x,y) \\ge 0\\). If \\(S&lt;0\\), it means the worker–firm pair is actually worse than their outside options (perhaps they are mismatched such that they prefer to wait for better partners). Thus, equilibrium is characterized by an acceptance set: \\[\n\\mathcal{M} = \\{(x,y): S(x,y) \\ge 0\\},\n\\] and a rejection for pairs outside this set. Because \\(W_0(x)\\) and \\(Π_0(y)\\) generally increase with \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) (better types have better prospects), the surplus \\(S(x,y)\\) might not be monotonic in \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) in a simple way. However, one can think of a reservation strategy: for a given worker type \\(x\\), there is some minimum firm type \\(y_{\\min}(x)\\) she is willing to accept (such that \\(S(x,y_{\\min}(x)) = 0\\)). Similarly, a firm \\(y\\) might have a lowest acceptable worker type \\(x_{\\min}(y)\\). The loci defined by \\(S(x,y)=0\\) are the boundary of the matching set in the \\((x,y)\\) plane. In a positively assortative equilibrium, we expect these boundaries to be increasing functions (higher-\\(x\\) workers have higher cutoff \\(y\\), and vice versa), so that \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) is a “convex” region (e.g. above a single increasing curve). If the boundaries are not monotonic, the matching pattern can be non-assortative or even non-contiguous (e.g. workers of type around \\(x=0.5\\) might skip matching with similar firms of \\(y\\approx0.5\\) and only take much higher or lower \\(y\\), creating a hole in the middle of \\(\\mathcal{M}\\)!).\n\n\nWage Determination\nIf a match forms, how is the surplus split? Shimer and Smith assume Nash bargaining with worker bargaining weight \\(\\alpha \\in [0,1]\\). The wage \\(w(x,y)\\) is set such that each party’s surplus share is proportional to their bargaining weight. The Nash condition can be written as: \\[\n(1-\\alpha)\\,[W_1(x,y) - W_0(x)] = \\alpha\\,[\\Pi_1(x,y) - \\Pi_0(y)].\n\\] This implies the worker’s surplus (left side) is \\((\\alpha/(1-\\alpha))\\) times the firm’s surplus. Using \\(W_1 - W_0\\) and \\(Π_1 - Π_0\\) definitions, one finds the wage gives the worker a payoff: \\[\nW_1(x,y) = W_0(x) + \\alpha\\,S(x,y),\n\\] and firm gets \\(Π_1(x,y) = \\Pi_0(y) + (1-\\alpha) S(x,y)\\). In terms of flow payoffs, the wage rate \\(w(x,y)\\) must satisfy \\[\nw(x,y) = \\text{(worker’s flow outside option)} + \\alpha \\times \\text{(flow surplus)}.\n\\] If unemployment yields zero, the outside option is essentially the option value of continuing search; more generally, \\(w(x,y)\\) can be interpreted as the sum of the worker’s fallback income plus a fraction \\(\\alpha\\) of the match surplus \\(f(x,y) - (\\text{fallbacks})\\). A key takeaway is that the wage depends on both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in a non-separable way through \\(S(x,y)\\). We can rewrite it as: \\[\nw(x,y) = W_0(x) + \\alpha\\big(f(x,y) - W_0(x) - \\Pi_0(y)\\big).\n\\] Expanding, this becomes \\[\nw(x,y) = (1-\\alpha)\\,W_0(x) + \\alpha\\,f(x,y) - \\alpha\\,\\Pi_0(y).\n\\] &gt; This is a crucial result. Notice the \\(\\alpha f(x,y)\\) term. The wage isn’t just a sum of a worker part and a firm part. It explicitly depends on the interaction between the two. This is the “smoking gun” that shows how sorting models fundamentally conflict with the simple additive structure of the AKM model.\nUnless \\(f(x,y)\\) is additively separable in \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), this wage is not expressible as \\(\\phi(x) + \\psi(y)\\) alone. There is an interaction term \\(\\alpha [f(x,y) - g(x) - h(y)]\\) embedded in it. This highlights that in a sorting model with bargaining, wages will generally violate the AKM form (additive worker and firm fixed effects). We will elaborate on this conflict with AKM in the next section, but intuitively, the \\(\\alpha f(x,y)\\) component is a match effect that cannot be absorbed into fixed effects without error.\n\n\nWhen Does PAM Survive with Search?\nThe introduction of frictions complicates assortative matching. Even if \\(f(x,y)\\) is supermodular, agents might reject equal-type matches in pursuit of higher surplus pairings, leading to partial sorting or even segmentation. Shimer and Smith demonstrate that stronger conditions than \\(f_{xy}&gt;0\\) are needed to guarantee PAM in equilibrium with search. The crucial concept is single-peaked preferences over partner type, which in turn requires a condition called log-supermodularity of \\(f\\).\nIn essence, log-supermodularity means that the percentage gain from increasing your partner’s type is higher for higher-type individuals. Formally, \\(f\\) is log-supermodular if \\(\\frac{\\partial^2 \\ln f(x,y)}{\\partial x \\partial y} &gt; 0\\). Equivalently, the ratio \\(\\frac{f(x,y)f(x',y')}{f(x,y')f(x',y)} &gt; 1\\) for \\(x'&gt;x, y'&gt;y\\). This condition, along with some regularity on \\(f_x\\) and \\(f_y\\), ensures that even the lower-type agents’ utility is single-peaked in the partner’s type [@ShimerSmith2000].\n\nIn plain terms, for sorting to hold up, the “kick” from getting a better partner has to be so strong (in percentage terms) that it outweighs the temptation to wait for a hypothetical “perfect” match that may never arrive. A low-type worker might prefer a middle-type firm to a very high-type firm if \\(f\\) is only weakly supermodular (because the very high-type firm might rather hold out for a higher worker, so the low worker anticipates a low surplus or offer). Log-supermodularity prevents such non-monotonic preferences by making every type sufficiently eager for higher-type partners.\n\nShimer–Smith Result: If \\(f(x,y)\\) is log-supermodular (and \\(f_{xy}&gt;0\\)), then in any steady-state search equilibrium (for any meeting rates, etc.), the matching is positively assortative. In fact, they prove that the matching set is convex and boundaries monotonic: higher-\\(x\\) workers have higher cutoff \\(y_{\\min}(x)\\). Thus PAM holds robustly despite frictions. By contrast, if \\(f_{xy}&gt;0\\) but \\(f\\) is not log-supermodular, assortative matching can fail. They provide counterexamples where the middle-range types do not match with each other (each preferring to hold out for higher types), resulting in a non-monotonic acceptance set. Essentially, with search frictions, agents consider the option value of continuing search. If medium types anticipate possibly meeting high types, they might reject each other, causing a breakdown in strict sorting. Shimer and Smith show that convexity of matching sets is necessary for PAM, and log-supermodularity (plus some orientation conditions) guarantees that convexity.\nOn the flip side, log-submodularity (\\(\\partial^2 \\ln f &lt; 0\\)) provides symmetric conditions for negative sorting under search. If \\(f\\) is so substitutable that even in percentage terms high-high is relatively unproductive, then high types prefer low-type partners, leading to NAM in equilibrium. But if \\(f\\) is only submodular (not log-submodular), search frictions might again complicate the pattern (some medium-medium matches might still happen due to option values).\n\n\nExample\nAs an illustration, Shimer–Smith discuss a production function \\(f(x,y)=x + y - x y\\) (for \\(x,y \\in [0,1]\\)) which is submodular (\\(f_{xy}=-1\\)). They show that medium types avoid matching with each other because they each hope to meet a “high” type partner. Thus, types around \\(0.5\\) delay matching with each other, leading to a situation where they only match with significantly higher or lower types, not peers. This is a failure of PAM due to a nonconvex acceptance set. However, if we assume a production like \\(f(x,y)=x^\\rho y^\\rho\\) (a log-supermodular function when \\(\\rho&gt;0\\)), then preferences are single-peaked and PAM holds for any search friction.\n\n\nEfficiency and Uniqueness\nIt’s worth noting that, unlike the frictionless model, the equilibrium matching with search need not be globally output-maximizing or unique. There can be multiple self-consistent acceptance patterns. However, under conditions that yield PAM or NAM, typically the sorting pattern is part of any equilibrium selection. The log-supermodular condition essentially pins down a unique assortative equilibrium. If those conditions fail, multiple equilibria with different sorting patterns can arise (some more sorted than others), and the market outcome might be less efficient due to search externalities (agents do not internalize how their acceptance decisions affect others).\nTo summarize, in the Shimer–Smith search model: 1. Match Surplus \\(S(x,y)\\) determines who matches with whom, via \\(S(x,y) \\ge 0\\). 2. With Nash bargaining, wages are \\(w(x,y) = W_0(x) + \\alpha S(x,y)\\), embedding match-specific surplus sharing. 3. PAM requires stronger complementarity: \\(f_{xy}&gt;0\\) is not enough; something like log-supermodularity ensures that the equilibrium acceptance sets are monotonic (convex), yielding positive sorting. 4. If complementarity is weaker, we may observe partial sorting or even mixing of types in equilibrium. Search frictions thus tighten the requirements for assortative matching: intuitively, a mild complementarity might be overwhelmed by strategic waiting, whereas very strong complementarity guarantees that even lower types prefer incrementally higher partners rather than skipping grades."
