## Why the Law of One Price Fails in Labor Markets

The **Law of One Price** suggests that in competitive markets, identical goods should command identical prices. By analogy, one might expect that **identical workers with same skills, education, and experience should earn identical wages**, regardless of where they work.

But the empirical reality is starkly different. Two equally experienced workers with the same education and job title may earn vastly different wages depending on where they work. Why does the law fail in labor markets?

The failure of wage equalization reveals market frictions:

- **Incomplete information**: Workers do not observe all job offers or wage distributions.
- **Limited mobility**: Geography, family ties, or institutional constraints can limit movement.
- **Firm heterogeneity**: Employers differ in productivity, market power, and rent-sharing norms.
- **Search and matching frictions**: Job-finding is not instantaneous, and not all workers see the same set of firms.

Thus, we arrive at an important question in labor economics:

> **Are wage differences mainly about “who” the worker is, or “where” they work?**

## The AKM Framework

In their 1999 paper, *High Wage Workers and High Wage Firms*, John Abowd, Francis Kramarz, and David Margolis (hereafter AKM) formalized a method to decompose wages into:

- a **person effect**: what a worker earns across jobs due to their intrinsic attributes
- a **firm effect**: what a firm pays, regardless of who works there

Before the AKM framework, separating how much of a person's wage was due to their individual skill versus the firm they worked for was a fundamental and notoriously difficult problem. 

The primary obstacle is positive assortative matching, or the strong tendency for high-skilled workers to be employed at high-paying, highly productive firms. This matching is not random; it is the result of a two-sided search.

Workers seek out the best firms: Ambitious and talented individuals actively look for companies that offer higher wages, better benefits, and greater opportunities for growth.

Firms seek out the best workers: The most successful and profitable firms compete to recruit and retain the most skilled and productive talent to maintain their competitive edge.

This non-random sorting creates a major statistical hurdle. If you simply observe that "Firm A" pays higher average wages than "Firm B," you cannot know the true cause. Is Firm A genuinely more generous or productive (a high firm effect), or has it simply managed to hire a more skilled workforce (a concentration of high person effects)?

With traditional data, such as a cross-sectional survey of workers and firms at a single point in time, these two forces are statistically entangled. Any attempt to measure the firm's true pay premium would be contaminated by the unobserved skills of the workers it hired. This is a classic case of omitted variable bias, where "innate worker ability" is the omitted variable that biases the estimate of the firm's effect on wages. Without the ability to track the same worker as they move between different firms, we were largely unable to resolve this puzzle.

Their innovation relied on **matched employer-employee longitudinal data**, allowing them to track millions of workers as they moved across firms over time.


### The Econometric Model

Let:

- \( y_{it} \): log wage of worker \( i \) at time \( t \)
- \( J(i,t) \): firm employing worker \( i \) at time \( t \)

The AKM model:

\[
y_{it} = \mathbf{x}_{it}\beta + \theta_i + \psi_{J(i,t)} + \varepsilon_{it}
\]

where:

- \( \mathbf{x}_{it} \): observed, time-varying worker characteristics (e.g., experience)
- \( \theta_i \): **person fixed effect** (portable across firms)
- \( \psi_j \): **firm fixed effect** (applies to all workers at firm \( j \))
- \( \varepsilon_{it} \): residual (transitory shocks, measurement error)

This is a **two-way fixed effects model**, statistically analogous to difference-in-differences, but applied to panel data with crossing entities (people × firms).

## Why Identification Is Difficult: Person vs Place

Imagine you observe that a worker at Firm A earns more than a worker at Firm B. How do you know if it's because:

- Worker A is more skilled (high \( \theta_i \))
- Firm A pays more (high \( \psi_j \))

If no one ever switches jobs, this distinction is **not identified**. This is the **core identification problem** in wage decomposition.

### The Solution: Worker Mobility

AKM's breakthrough was to exploit **worker mobility**:

- When a worker switches from Firm A to Firm B, we observe how their wage changes.
- Since \( \theta_i \) is fixed, the change is attributable to \( \psi_B - \psi_A \).

By tracking millions of such moves, AKM recover relative firm effects—**so long as the data form a connected mobility graph**.

In their French dataset, over 88% of the labor force participated in this mobility network, making identification of both \( \theta_i \) and \( \psi_j \) possible for most of the economy.

## Estimation Strategy: Scaling Two-Way Fixed Effects

### Computational Challenge

The AKM model requires estimating fixed effects for ~1 million individuals and ~500,000 firms. Ordinary least squares is computationally infeasible.

### Estimation by Residualization (Person-First Method)

Their preferred strategy proceeds in two steps:

1. **Regress wages on \( \mathbf{x}_{it} \) and person dummies** to estimate \( \hat{\theta}_i \).
2. **Regress the residuals** on firm dummies to estimate \( \hat{\psi}_j \).

This method works well because **person effects explain more variance than firm effects**, so controlling for them first improves precision.

## Key Findings from AKM (1999)

### 1. Person Effects Dominate Wage Variation

- The standard deviation of person effects is **substantially larger** than that of firm effects.
- **Most of the wage inequality** comes from differences in \( \theta_i \), not \( \psi_j \).

> Implication: Inequality in wages primarily reflects differences in worker productivity, skill, or other portable traits.

### 2. Industry Wage Differentials Are Not About Firms

AKM show that **inter-industry wage gaps** mostly reflect **sorting**:

- Workers in high-paying industries would earn high wages anywhere.
- Only ~10% of the gap is due to firm-level pay premiums.

> The oil industry doesn’t pay more because it’s generous, but because it hires high-ability workers.

### 3. The Firm-Size Wage Premium is Mostly Sorting

Larger firms pay more—but mostly because they **hire better workers**:

- ~75% of the firm-size wage gap is explained by person effects.
- The actual firm premium (net of sorting) is small and non-monotonic.

> This challenges simple monopsony or institutional explanations of the size-wage premium.

### 4. High-Wage Firms Are More Productive and Profitable

- Firms with high \( \psi_j \) (pay more than worker’s market value) are **more productive and profitable**.
- This supports **rent-sharing** and **efficiency wage** theories.

> Paying above-market wages is not just charity—it is a strategy that correlates with firm performance.

## Legacy and Extensions

The AKM decomposition has become foundational in:

- Gender wage gap research
- Studies of rent-sharing and labor market power
- Analysis of trade shocks and firm-worker sorting
- Inequality dynamics and occupational mobility

By clearly separating the **“who you are”** from **“where you work”**, AKM transformed the empirical study of wage determination.
