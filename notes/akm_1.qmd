## Introduction

The Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999) model is a cornerstone of modern labor economics. It decomposes wage variation into components attributable to worker heterogeneity and firm heterogeneity. This note provides a brief theoretical overview and a guide to its implementation.

## Theoretical Framework

The canonical AKM model can be expressed as:

$$
y_{it} = \alpha_i + \psi_{j(i,t)} + X'_{it}\beta + \epsilon_{it}
$$

Where:
- $y_{it}$ is the log wage for worker $i$ at time $t$.
- $\alpha_i$ is a person-specific effect (worker fixed effect).
- $\psi_{j(i,t)}$ is a firm-specific effect for firm $j$ where worker $i$ is employed at time $t$.
- $X'_{it}$ is a vector of time-varying covariates.
- $\epsilon_{it}$ is the error term.

The key insight is that by observing workers moving between firms, we can separately identify the wage premium associated with individual skills ($\alpha_i$) and firm-specific pay policies ($\psi_j$).

## Practical Implementation

Here is a simple example of how to estimate the model in R. First, you'll need a panel dataset with worker and firm identifiers.
