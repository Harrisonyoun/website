## Introduction: Why the Law of One Price Fails in Labor Markets

A canonical principle in economics—the **Law of One Price**—suggests that in competitive markets, identical goods should command identical prices. Applied to labor, this implies that **identical workers should earn identical wages**, regardless of where they work.

But the empirical reality is starkly different. Two equally experienced workers with the same education and job title may earn vastly different wages depending on where they work. Why does the law fail in labor markets?

The failure of wage equalization reveals deeper market frictions:

- **Incomplete information**: Workers may not know which firms pay more.
- **Imperfect mobility**: Geographic, social, or institutional constraints limit job switching.
- **Heterogeneous firms**: Wage-setting varies with productivity, rent-sharing, or HR strategy.
- **Search and matching frictions**: Not all workers have access to the same jobs.

Thus, we arrive at a core question in labor economics:

> **Are wage differences mainly about “who” the worker is, or “where” they work?**

This is not merely an academic distinction. It affects how we understand inequality, returns to education, firm competition, and the design of labor policy.

## The AKM Framework: A Rigorous Answer

In their 1999 Econometrica paper, *High Wage Workers and High Wage Firms*, John Abowd, Francis Kramarz, and David Margolis (AKM) formalized a method to decompose wages into:

- a **person effect**: what a worker earns across jobs due to their intrinsic attributes
- a **firm effect**: what a firm pays, regardless of who works there

Their innovation relied on **matched employer-employee longitudinal data**, allowing them to track millions of workers as they moved across firms over time.

### The Statistical Model

Let:

- \( y_{it} \): log wage of worker \( i \) at time \( t \)
- \( J(i,t) \): firm employing worker \( i \) at time \( t \)

The AKM model:

\[
y_{it} = \mathbf{x}_{it}\beta + \theta_i + \psi_{J(i,t)} + \varepsilon_{it}
\]

where:

- \( \mathbf{x}_{it} \): observed, time-varying worker characteristics (e.g., experience)
- \( \theta_i \): **person fixed effect** (portable across firms)
- \( \psi_j \): **firm fixed effect** (applies to all workers at firm \( j \))
- \( \varepsilon_{it} \): residual (transitory shocks, measurement error)

This is a **two-way fixed effects model**, statistically analogous to difference-in-differences, but applied to panel data with crossing entities (people × firms).

## Why Identification Is Difficult: Person vs Place

Imagine you observe that a worker at Firm A earns more than a worker at Firm B. How do you know if it's because:

- Worker A is more skilled (high \( \theta_i \))
- Firm A pays more (high \( \psi_j \))

If no one ever switches jobs, this distinction is **not identified**. This is the **core identification problem** in wage decomposition.

### The Solution: Worker Mobility

AKM's breakthrough was to exploit **worker mobility**:

- When a worker switches from Firm A to Firm B, we observe how their wage changes.
- Since \( \theta_i \) is fixed, the change is attributable to \( \psi_B - \psi_A \).

By tracking millions of such moves, AKM recover relative firm effects—**so long as the data form a connected mobility graph**.

In their French dataset, over 88% of the labor force participated in this mobility network, making identification of both \( \theta_i \) and \( \psi_j \) possible for most of the economy.

## Estimation Strategy: Scaling Two-Way Fixed Effects

### Computational Challenge

The AKM model requires estimating fixed effects for ~1 million individuals and ~500,000 firms. Ordinary least squares is computationally infeasible.

### Estimation by Residualization (Person-First Method)

Their preferred strategy proceeds in two steps:

1. **Regress wages on \( \mathbf{x}_{it} \) and person dummies** to estimate \( \hat{\theta}_i \).
2. **Regress the residuals** on firm dummies to estimate \( \hat{\psi}_j \).

This method works well because **person effects explain more variance than firm effects**, so controlling for them first improves precision.

## Key Findings from AKM (1999)

### 1. Person Effects Dominate Wage Variation

- The standard deviation of person effects is **substantially larger** than that of firm effects.
- **Most of the wage inequality** comes from differences in \( \theta_i \), not \( \psi_j \).

> Implication: Inequality in wages primarily reflects differences in worker productivity, skill, or other portable traits.

### 2. Industry Wage Differentials Are Not About Firms

AKM show that **inter-industry wage gaps** mostly reflect **sorting**:

- Workers in high-paying industries would earn high wages anywhere.
- Only ~10% of the gap is due to firm-level pay premiums.

> The oil industry doesn’t pay more because it’s generous, but because it hires high-ability workers.

### 3. The Firm-Size Wage Premium is Mostly Sorting

Larger firms pay more—but mostly because they **hire better workers**:

- ~75% of the firm-size wage gap is explained by person effects.
- The actual firm premium (net of sorting) is small and non-monotonic.

> This challenges simple monopsony or institutional explanations of the size-wage premium.

### 4. High-Wage Firms Are More Productive and Profitable

- Firms with high \( \psi_j \) (pay more than worker’s market value) are **more productive and profitable**.
- This supports **rent-sharing** and **efficiency wage** theories.

> Paying above-market wages is not just charity—it is a strategy that correlates with firm performance.

## Legacy and Extensions

The AKM decomposition has become foundational in:

- Gender wage gap research
- Studies of rent-sharing and labor market power
- Analysis of trade shocks and firm-worker sorting
- Inequality dynamics and occupational mobility

By clearly separating the **“who you are”** from **“where you work”**, AKM transformed the empirical study of wage determination.
