There is a figure in psychology known as the *puer aeternus*, the eternal child. It is the one who clings to possibility, who fears that choosing one path means losing every other, who prefers to hover in imagination rather than step into the weight of reality. It is not a type found only in books. Many of us recognize it in ourselves. We imagine the perfect job that will finally reveal our true calling, the perfect partner who will never disappoint, the perfect moment when we will at last begin. Until then, we wait. And in waiting, life slips past.

The eternal child is clever, often charming, full of bright beginnings. They throw themselves into new projects with energy, but when the work becomes slow and repetitive, enthusiasm fades. They fall in love with ideals, but when ordinary flaws appear in another person, they see them as a betrayal rather than a part of reality. They dream of writing a novel, painting a canvas, building a company, but the actual hours of practice feel beneath them. In this way, they confuse freedom with suspension, mistaking endless options for superiority while never allowing one life to ripen.

We see this everywhere. A young professional leaves job after job, convinced that the next firm, the next city, the next title will finally align with their destiny. A relationship ends at the first sign of boredom, because love was imagined as a perpetual spark rather than a steady flame. A student skips from hobby to hobby, producing shelves of half-finished projects and notebooks of ideas that never materialize. In the age of dating apps and infinite feeds, possibilities stretch out like a glittering horizon. But this horizon recedes as we walk, and behind us lies a trail of abandoned commitments.

Opposed to this is not the rigid cynic, but the person who embraces ordinariness. This is the one who understands that greatness is not measured in spectacular moments but in the quiet rhythm of showing up. Think of the baker who rises before dawn each day to knead dough. From the outside it may look monotonous. But the bread on the table nourishes families, carries memories, builds trust in a neighborhood. Think of the nurse who tends to patients on the night shift, exhausted but steady, carrying out the same procedures again and again. There is little glamour here, but there is dignity, and the kind of heroism that allows a society to function. Think of a parent washing dishes, packing lunches, listening to their child’s stumbling stories at the end of a long day. These are not interruptions to life. They *are* life. And in them is a greatness no fantasy can match.

Ordinariness has always been difficult to honor, but in our culture it is especially hard. Advertisements tell us to be exceptional. Social media shows us highlight reels of other people’s brightest hours. Self-help promises transformation in thirty days. Surrounded by these messages, we come to believe that unless life is extraordinary, it is failing. This is the soil in which the eternal child thrives. Ordinary work feels like betrayal. Ordinary relationships feel insufficient. Ordinary days feel like mistakes. But it is all an illusion. The spectacular moments of life are rare and fleeting. What gives them meaning is the countless hours of unseen, unglamorous effort that prepared them. To despise the ordinary is to despise the very ground on which joy stands.

At the heart of the eternal child lies a paradox of freedom. To them, freedom means keeping every possibility open, never closing doors, never binding themselves to one path. It feels like superiority, as though by remaining uncommitted they hover above the ordinary world. Yet this endless deferral becomes its own kind of prison. A life that refuses limits cannot take shape. The longer we hover above choices, the more we become trapped in suspension, unable to live any of them. What looks like freedom in the moment often reveals itself, years later, as paralysis. Real freedom does not lie in endless options, it lies in choosing and then inhabiting that choice fully. To bind oneself, to a vocation, to a partner, to a community, looks at first like the loss of liberty, but in practice it opens a deeper freedom, the freedom to grow roots, to gain mastery, to become someone real.

There is also a danger in heroizing even the rejection of dreams. Some resolve, “I will live an ordinary life,” but they make even this into a performance, another way of being special. Yet true ordinariness cannot be a costume we wear. It is discovered in fidelity: in doing the work again tomorrow, in listening again today, in keeping promises when no one is watching. Heroism is not abolished. It is simply relocated. The real heroism is in loyalty to what is plain and repetitive, in the courage to keep loving and building when no one applauds.

Economics, in its own way, tells the same story. Workers who leap from job to job in search of the perfect role may preserve the illusion of freedom, but they lose the compounding power of experience. Human capital grows through repetition, through enduring the dull stages of learning until skill takes root. Consumers who insist on keeping all options open feel restless and unsatisfied. The paradox of choice shows that too many options make us less happy, not more. Opportunity cost is misunderstood: we fear the cost of closing doors, but forget the cost of never entering any room at all. To commit is to accept sunk costs, to embrace limits, to build value through patience. Dreams without commitment are like options that expire unused. They look valuable on paper, but they never pay out.

The eternal child, then, is not an enemy to be destroyed but a part of us to be guided. Their longing for possibility keeps imagination alive. But imagination must become a compass, not a dwelling. To live only in possibility is to become a ghost in our own story. To step into ordinariness is to become real. The greatness of a life lies not in infinite options but in finite fidelity, not in escaping repetition but in allowing repetition to shape us. It is found in the simple acts of baking bread, keeping promises, raising children, caring for neighbors, building skills, and honoring commitments. These are not small things. They are the substance of life itself.

The courage we need is not the courage to be extraordinary. It is the courage to be ordinary: to cook dinner again tonight, to go to work again tomorrow, to keep faith in love after disappointment, to let go of the fantasy that we can be everything, and instead learn the joy of becoming someone. In this choice lies the end of the eternal child, and the beginning of a life that truly sings. The greatness of life is not hidden in extraordinary peaks but in ordinary valleys. To be ordinary is not to fail, it is to stand on the only ground where joy can take root.
